Overview
========

The Resource Description Framework (`RDF`_) is a standard model for data
interchange on the Web.

RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use (`URI`_)s to name the
relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is
usually referred to as a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows
structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across
different applications.

This linking structure forms a directed, labeled `Graph`_, where the edges
represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes.
This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used
in easy-to-understand visual explanations.
