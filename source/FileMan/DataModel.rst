Exploring Fileman
=================

A good way to start showing Fileman is to look at a file whose structure is typical. I would choose the language file for the exercise.

Enter mumps first by sourcing ``gtmprofile`` as before and running ``mumps -dir``. Then run Fileman by typing ``D C^DI``. You do not have to know what that means, as the rest of Fileman doesn't require you to type Mumps commands.

.. Note:: Because the device handler is part of the VISTA Kernel, Fileman ships with a very rudimentary device handler. Paging through data may be somewhat painful. If you have unlimited scrollback on your terminal emulator, you may wish to change the variable IOSL in routine _ZIS to be 9999999 from the original 24. This way you don't have to keep pressing enter.

The first thing we will do is a data dictionary (i.e. Schema) of the language file. Text in ** ** is text you have to type::

    GTM>**D C^DI**

What you see here is the condensed data dictionary listing for the language
file.

Before we explain the condensed data dictionary listing, let's talk about the
Fileman user interface. Unlike most databases, Fileman includes the end user
interface as part of it. You just saw a few conventions up here:

 * To accept your input, you must press enter/return.
 * Typing ``?`` means ask for help. On a menu, it give you the menu choices.
   Not shown above, but typing ``??`` may give you more help, especially when
   editing data.
 * You can pick entries either by their number or their name. That's true
   across all of Fileman.
 * Default answers are indicated using the answer then a //. Pressing enter
   without typing in a different answer will accept the default. Elsewhere in
   Fileman, if you are prompted to "Replace", you need to type "?" and follow
   the help on how to override the default. Replace only shows up if the
   default value is really long (above 15 characters). 

Alright. Now it's time to figure out what that condensed listing means. In
general, each line in this listing represents a "column" in relational database
parlance. There are two exceptions to this: ALTERNATE NAME field and
DESCRIPTION field. Both are as helpfully indicated multiples. A multiple means
that several entries can be stored. This means, for example, that a language
can have several alternate names. For example, Spanish can have ALTERNATE NAMEs
of EspaÃ±ol and Catalan. DESCRIPTION fields is a multiple in the way it's
stored, but really represents a single word processing (i.e. text blob) field. A word processing
field is stored by storing each line separately; that's why it's a multiple.

Let's analyze one entry and try to figure out what are all these letters and
symbols::

    .02       TWO LETTER CODE (FJ2), [0;2]

In Fileman, each field must be uniquely numbered, but not necessarily uniquely
named. In this case, the field number is .02; the field name is ``TWO LETTER
CODE``. The next set of alphanumerals in parentheses represent the field
storage formatting. In this case, ``FJ2`` means that it's 2 character long free
text field. The next and last set of alphanumberals in backets signify the
storage location of the data.

Storage Location?

Well you see, like C programmers with structures, it matters to Mumps programmers where
their data gets stored. In many cases, it's not important, but programmers
writing code may need to fetch the values directly from Mumps.

Ooops. Forgot to mention the second line of the output, while we are speaking
of storage locations. The second line says::

    STORED IN: ^DI(.85,

This means that the entire file is stored in ^DI(.85,

Now that we have a distant clue on how the language file is stored, let's
actually look at its contents. To do that, we will use the ``ZWRITE`` command.
ZWRITE is not part of Mumps, but it is rather a useful debugging tool to show
you the data. It exists on both GT.M and Cache, but is far more powerful on
GT.M. The output is really long, so I would only show you a few lines::

    GTM>ZWRITE ^DI(.85,*)
    ^DI(.85,0)="LANGUAGE^.85I^18^11"
    ^DI(.85,1,0)="ENGLISH^EN^ENG"
    ^DI(.85,1,1,0)="^.8501^2^2"
    ^DI(.85,1,1,1,0)="MODERN ENGLISH (1500-)"
    ^DI(.85,1,1,2,0)="ENGLISH,MODERN (1500-)"
    ^DI(.85,1,1,"B","ENGLISH,MODERN (1500-)",2)=""
    ^DI(.85,1,1,"B","MODERN ENGLISH (1500-)",1)=""
    <output elided>
    ^DI(.85,2,0)="GERMAN^DE^DEU^^GER"
    ^DI(.85,2,1,0)="^.8501^7^7"
    ^DI(.85,2,1,1,0)="GERMAN, STANDARD"
    <etc>

Good. We see the data. And you actually get a good taste of how Fileman does its work in the Mumps Virtual Machine. ^DI(.85) is the Mumps global (actually part of the global ^DI). Global in Mumps simply means permanent disk storage location; it doesn't refer to a variable that's global in scope, like in many other languages. Inside the global, it's subdivided into different pieces using the caret '^' symbol. Remember this?::

    .02       TWO LETTER CODE (FJ2), [0;2]

In the brackets you see the storage location as 0;2. This means that after the record number (which is the first subscript), you go the zero subscript and get the second caret piece to place the TWO LETTER CODE.

Can you spot the two letter codes above using the information I just gave you?

Notice that we have two records in this excerpt. The first record is ENGLISH, and the second is GERMAN. if you look at the ``^DI(.85,1,0)`` and ``^DI(.85,2,0)`` nodes, you will notice that the second piece of these nodes is EN and DE respectively.

Now that I showed you this view, I can present to you the Fileman Global Data Dictionary Listing. You access this by typing "GLOBAL" instead of "CONDENSED" in the data dictionary listing.::

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The LANGUAGE file is used both to officially identify a language, and to store
    MUMPS code needed to do language-specific conversions of data such as dates and
    numbers.  
     
    Fileman distributes entries for the following languages: 
     ID Number (.001)       Name (.01) 
                    1       English 
                    2       German 
                    3       Spanish 
                    4       French 
                    5       Finnish 
                    6       Italian 
                    7       Portuguese 
                   10       Arabic 
                   11       Russian 
                   12       Greek 
                   18       Hebrew 
     
    The ISO-639-1 and ISO-639-2 compatible language file is distributed in the 
    DMLAINIT routines, shipped with Fileman 22.2.  
     
    A pointer to this file from the TRANSLATION multiple on the DIALOG file also
    allows non-English text to be returned via FileMan calls.  
     
    A note to VISTA developers: Although users can select entries by name, software
    should use the official two or three letter codes to eliminiate mistakes
    resulting from languages that have similar spelling.
