Examples
========

This directory contains a set of examples that progressively introduce the
capabilities of M as available from Node.js.

To run this scripts you should have installed

* `GT.M`_
* `Node.js`_
* `nodem`_
* `ewdglobals`_

The majority of scripts will be executed as

           nodejs    scriptname.js

Examples from 01 to 10 introduce the direct connection with GT.M.

Examples 10 and up, introduce the integration of the M database
with the Node.js language constructs.
