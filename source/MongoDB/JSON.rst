JSON
=====

JSON is a data representation format based on plain text.

The following is an example of how JSON could be used for representing data
about Movies

::

  {
  title: "Forrest Gump",
  year: 1994,
  director: "Robert Zemeckis",
  writers: [ "Winston Groom", "Eric Roth" ],
  starts: [ "Tom Hanks", "Robin Wright", "Gary Sinise" ]
  }
 
Overall, it is composed of Key-Value pairs. A ":" symbol connect the key with
the value. Multiple key-value pairs are separated by commas. Values that have
multiple entries are grouped in square brackets "[...]".

The data structure can be nested, and this provides a great deal of flexibility
on how data can be represented.
