`MongoDB`_ is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-oriented
data store that's easy to deploy, manage and use.

It is network accessible, written in C++ and offers the following features : 
 
 * Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object- style data 
 * Full index support, including on inner objects 
 * Query profiling 
 * Replication and fail-over support 
 * Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. videos) 
 * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (Q209) 
   
High performance, scalability, and reasonable depth of functionality are the goals for the project.

The name Mongo comes from "humongous".
