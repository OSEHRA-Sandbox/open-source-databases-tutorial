This directory contains files that are expected to be copied into the server when it is configured for being used for the practical sessions of the class. 

The "root" directory here maps to the standard "/" of the Unix filesystem.

For example the file

          root/var/www/index.html

is expected to be copied in the server to the destination directory

              /var/www/index.html
